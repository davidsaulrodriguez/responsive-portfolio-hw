            My name is David Saul Rodriguez. I am 29 years old, and I am a
            huge advocate of open source software. I love developing software
            and I love working as a web developer. I started my journey with
            Open Source software back in 2004 with
            <a href="https://debian.org" target="_blank" title="Debian.org official website">
              Debian GNU/Linux
            </a>
            after <abbr title="Blue Screen of Death">BSOD</abbr>-ing my first laptop.
          </p>

          <p>One of the first things I ever did on Debian was begin to play with the terminal. I began to inquire about the <abbr title="Bourne Again SHell">BASH</abbr> terminal via Google and how it worked. I started to learn and teach myself basic
            terminal commands. First learning how to create, delete and move files. Soon after I taught myself how to work with input and output redirection and eventually learning how to use the <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_%28Unix%29" title="Learn more about the Unix Pipeline via Wikipedia">unix<sup>&reg;</sup> pipeline</a>.</p>

          <p>Eventually I found myself dabbling in source code. A lot of it! Afterall, I found the holy grail of code. Whole online communities were both sharing their code and helping their fellow developers online for free! The best part was, they
            never asked for anything except for you to pay it forward. Share your work and help others if and when you can. From then on, I was hooked! I became a hardcore Open Source software enthusiast and evangelist. It's only recently that I've
            decided to get into Web Development. But I would have to say that my 15 years in the open source and Unix/Linux communities have given me a deep understanding towards how the tools work and where to go when I need help.</p>
